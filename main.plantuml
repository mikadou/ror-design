class SimController {
    Handles all gameplay simulation
    (only logic + sound, no graphics)
    --
}

class PhysicsWorld {
    Manages raw softbodies - just dynamics and collisions, no gfx.
    Manages actors and static terrain objects
    --
}

class Actor {
    Raw softbody
}

class Scripting {
    Reads and updates flexbodies and
    other sim state to implement gameplay logic
    --
}

class GfxScene {
    Reads data from SimController (which reads PhysicsWorld)
    and maintains a visual representation of it
    --
}
